Rather you must clearly demonstrate HOW, WHEN, and WHERE the qualification was met through substantiation by examples. Information on your described skills, experience, etc. provided in the screening questions should be supported by your resume. Failure to provide sufficient information will result in the candidate being screened out and rejected from the process. By answering the screening questions, you certify that the answers provided were prepared by you and that you are the sole author. Management has opted to use screening and text questions and answers, accompanied by the resume, as the evaluation method for the screening stage of this selection process. Failure to provide this information in the requested fields may result in your application being rejected. You must be able to provide proof of your education credentials. Persons are entitled to participate in the appointment process in the official language(s) of their choice. Candidates must meet all of the essential qualifications noted in the Statement of Merit Criteria to be appointed to a position. For this selection process, it is our intention to communicate with candidates via email for screening and assessment purposes. This will include communication of results and invitations to assessments. To that end, candidates must ensure a valid email address is included in their application. It is the candidate’s responsibility to ensure that this address is functional and that it accepts messages from unknown users (some email systems block these types of email) and frequently check their inbox and JUNK/SPAM folders. It is also the candidate’s responsibility to ensure accurate information is provided and updated as required.",
